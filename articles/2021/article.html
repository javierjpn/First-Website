      <h2>Atlanta Braves win 2021 championship</h2>
      <p> The Atlanta Braves are World Series champions for the first time since 1995. The Braves           won the 2021 World Series on Tuesday, defeating the Houston Astros 7-0 (box score) in Game 
      to take the series, 4-2. The Braves, who won the title at Houston's Minute Maid Park, were
      paced by an  offensive onslaught and a gem from left-hander Max Fried in the title-clinching
      win.</p>

      <p>Atlanta jumped out to a sizable lead thanks to two multi-run home runs early in the game.
      Jorge Soler delivered a massive three-run blast in the third inning to put Atlanta up early.
      Statcast had Soler's home run traveling 446 feet with an exit velocity of 109.6 mph.</p>

      <p>Soler, who was named World Series MVP, entered the game having homered twice as part of a 5
      to 17 start to the Fall Classic. In Game 6, he hit the loudest homer of the postseason</p>
